# 24 And Now What? {#chapter-und-nun}

The book showed different concepts and recipes with different
technologies. In each chapter there was a section on "variations".
From the concepts, recipes, and their variations, you now have to
create your own menu.

Here are some tips:

* *Adapting* and *combining* the recipes is a must.
Each project is different and needs its own technology solution.

* The most interesting thing about the selected technology stack is
the *reason for the choice*. No one can relieve the project of the
responsibility for this technology choice. That's why it must be
well-considered. Whether it was indeed well-considered can be seen in the reasoning given for the decision.

* The introduction of microservices is an architectural change. It is
often accompanied by organizational changes and the introduction of many new technologies.
No project can cope with *too many changes at once*. Therefore, as few
new technologies as possible should be introduced at once, and simple
technologies should be preferred. Finally, the introduction of
technologies can take place gradually. The complete technology stack
may not yet be necessary for the first microservice.

* The *migration* of an existing system has a lot of influence on the
decisions taken when implementing the microservices architecture.
Sticking with technologies and architectures already used in the old
system can simplify migration.

* The *skills* of the team members involved are also an important
influencing factor. If no one has experience with a technology, that's
a risk.

* The examples from the book facilitate familiarization with the
technologies. However, for a 
production environment, factors such as *fail-safety, load
balancing, and clusters* must be considered.

The overview of the recipes has hopefully made it easier to get
started in the world of microservices and maybe it was fun, too. I
wish you every success with microservices!
