# Part III: Operation {#chapter-betrieb}

The third part of the book discusses the operation of
microservices. In a microservices environment a system consists of
many microservices. These
need to be operated. In case of a deployment
monolith, just a single systems must be operated. Therefore,
operation is a very important topic for a 
microservices environment.

#### Operation: Basics

First, [chapter 19](#chapter-betrieb-grundlagen) introduces the basics
of operating microservices.

#### Monitoring with Prometheus

[Chapter 20](#chapter-monitoring) deals with the monitoring of
microservices and describes Prometheus as concrete tool. 

#### Log Data Analysis with the Elastic Stack

The topic of [chapter 21](#chapter-log-analyse) is the analysis of log
data. The Elastic stack is introduced as concrete technical approach
for log data analysis.

#### Tracing with Zipkin

[Chapter 22](#chapter-tracing) explains how Zipkin can be
used to trace requests across multiple microservices.

#### Service Meshes wit Istio

Service meshes like Istio add proxies to the network traffic in a
microservice systems. This allows support for monitoring, tracing and
resilience without any impact on the code. [Chapter
23](#chapter-service-mesh) discusses Istio as an example of a service
mesh.

#### Conclusion of the Book

The book ends with an outlook in [chapter 24](#chapter-und-nun).
