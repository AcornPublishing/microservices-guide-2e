# Part I: Principles of Microservices {#chapter-basic}

The first part of this book introduces the fundamental ideas underlying microservice-based architectures.

#### Microservices

[Chapter 1](#chapter-microservices) explains the basics about *microservices*. What are microservices? Which benefits and disadvantages do microservice architectures have?

#### Micro and Macro Architecture

Microservices offer a lot of freedom. Still, some decisions have to be made that affect all microservices of a system. [Chapter 2](#chapter-mikro-makro) introduces the concept of *micro and macro architecture*. Micro architecture comprises all decisions which can be made individually for each microservice. Macro architecture on the other hand comprises the decisions which concern all microservices. In addition to the components of micro and macro architecture, the book also explains who designs macro architecture.

#### Migration

Most microservice projects serve to migrate an existing system into a
microservices architecture. Therefore, [chapter 3](#chapter-migration)
presents possible objectives for a *migration* and introduces
different strategies for migrations.
